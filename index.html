            <h3>Friday, April 9th</h3>
            <p>Today was a slowpaced day.<br>
                My statistic class was cancelled and professor posted a video instead.
                I like watching video lectures because I can pause whenever I get distracted and rewatch it. After
                watching a video I attended Humanities lecture.
                We read a rather complicated poem that I couldn't understand before the lecture. However, after the
                lecture, it was more clear to me.
                I also finished some homework assignments:
            </p>

                        <li>Online homework for <b class="class">MATH 183</b></li>
                        <li>Reflection for <b class="class">ENG 100D</b></li>
                        <li>Reading for <b class="class">HUM 5</b></li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <p>Later in the evening my roommate came from her shift and we watched a movie together.</p>

            <p>First, our club participated in Virtual Triton Day. It was nice to see many transfer students being
                interested in our club.
                After that, I had a meeting with my mentee and we talked about different project ideas. And finally I
                met with my team for
                <b class="class">CSE 110</b> class and we played some skribble.io and got to know each other. I'm
                looking forward to working with them on the project this quarter! </p>
            In the evening, my friend, who is also fully vaccinated, came over so we studied together and played on
            Switch afterwards.

            <h3>Sunday, April 11th</h3>
            <p>Today I woke up a little bit later than usual and made a <em>really</em> good coffee. I thought to myself
                <i> I only have to do my lab today, it should be quick</i>
                As I'm doing this lab assignment I should note to myself: <strong>Don't leave this until last
                    day</strong></p>
